Hi this is a project based on Artificial Intelligence.
The voice-based academic records retrieval system is a Python
application designed to retrieve records from an academic access
database using voice commands. By integrating speech recognition
capabilities, users can simply speak the UID of the person whose
academic records they want to retrieve, and the system will fetch
the corresponding records from the database. This report provides
an overview of the system, outlines the necessary packages, presents
a summary of the code implementation, discusses relevant research
in the field, and concludes with potential applications and future
enhancements.
